Laravel weather/air app with integrated Openweather API.
A special API interaction library has been made.
You can see the weather or air quality by city name. Also, the data is displayed in the form of graphs, using Chart.js.
The implementation of the site can be seen here: https://www.craftsman.org.ua/
